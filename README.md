## My second attempt at making a (Much better) punishment plugin.
### This plugin is a complete recode of my previous plugin eddition. 
This version is command based, while the previous version was GUI based. 
This plugin fetures customisable ban messages, a logging system, and is very 
light-weight!  This plugin depends on FoxRank v 1.4 or higher. (Found [Here](https://github.com/Foxikle/FoxRank)!)
